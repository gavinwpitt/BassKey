# BassKey

This is a project I developed in C# in order to teach myself some of the basics.

This project is a learning tool for beginner bass players. It is a set of 48 buttons (12 notes x 4 strings) arranged on a backdrop
intended to simulate a bass neck. At the top of the application you can poke around in the drop down menus to choose what mode
you would like to see, and then you can click a note and it will highlight all the notes contained within that key-mode.

For example, if you had 'Dorian' mode selected from the above drop down and then clicked any of the D notes, all the notes contained
within D-Dorian would be highlighted, with D (the root note) highlighted in a different color to help it stick out
